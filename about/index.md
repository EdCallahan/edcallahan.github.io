# About

I’m Ed Callahan — a data integration specialist, DBA, and automation engineer with a focus on building reliable, well‑documented tools for SQL Server and PowerShell environments.

After years supporting enterprise systems, I now publish the tools, patterns, and techniques that have proven themselves in real‑world production environments. My goal is to provide clear, example‑driven documentation that helps others solve problems efficiently and confidently.

This site serves as a hub for:

- PowerShell modules and scripts  
- SQL stored procedures and utilities  
- Troubleshooting guides  
- Technical notes and design patterns
